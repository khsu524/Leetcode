2.	Mr. Jason has captured your friend and has put a collar around his neck. He has locked the collar with a given “locking key”. Now it can only be opened with an “unlocking key”. Your friend sees the locking key but he does not know how to find the unlocking key. You can calculate the unlocking key if you have the locking key, because the unlocking key will be the smallest (in magnitude) permutation of the digits of the locking key and will never start with zero.

Input
the input to the function/method consists of an argument lockingKey, an integer representing the locking key.

Output
Return an interger representing the unlocking key.

Constraint
-10^7 <= lockingKey <= 10^7

Note
A possible answer exits for each input.

Example
Input
lockingKey = 756

Output
567

Explanation.
The samllest permutation formed with digits 5, 6 and 7 is 567.
So, the output is 567.
